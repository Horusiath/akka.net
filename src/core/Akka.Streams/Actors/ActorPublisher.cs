     * It can be attached to a [[org.reactivestreams.Subscriber]] or be used as an input source for a
     * [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow]]. You can only attach one subscriber to this publisher.
     *
     * The life cycle state of the subscription is tracked with the following boolean members:
     * [[#isActive]], [[#isCompleted]], [[#isErrorEmitted]], and [[#isCanceled]].
     *
     * You send elements to the stream by calling [[#onNext]]. You are allowed to send as many
     * elements as have been requested by the stream subscriber. This amount can be inquired with
     * [[#totalDemand]]. It is only allowed to use `onNext` when `isActive` and `totalDemand > 0`,
     * otherwise `onNext` will throw `IllegalStateException`.
     *
     * When the stream subscriber requests more elements the [[ActorPublisher#Request]] message
     * is delivered to this actor, and you can act on that event. The [[#totalDemand]]
     * is updated automatically.
     *
     * When the stream subscriber cancels the subscription the [[ActorPublisher#Cancel]] message
     * is delivered to this actor. After that subsequent calls to `onNext` will be ignored.
     *
     * You can complete the stream by calling [[#onComplete]]. After that you are not allowed to
     * call [[#onNext]], [[#onError]] and [[#onComplete]].
     *
     * You can terminate the stream with failure by calling [[#onError]]. After that you are not allowed to
     * call [[#onNext]], [[#onError]] and [[#onComplete]].
     *
     * If you suspect that this [[ActorPublisher]] may never get subscribed to, you can override the [[#subscriptionTimeout]]
     * method to provide a timeout after which this Publisher should be considered canceled. The actor will be notified when
     * the timeout triggers via an [[akka.stream.actor.ActorPublisherMessage.SubscriptionTimeoutExceeded]] message and MUST then perform cleanup and stop itself.
     *
     * If the actor is stopped the stream will be completed, unless it was not already terminated with
     * failure, completed or canceled.
