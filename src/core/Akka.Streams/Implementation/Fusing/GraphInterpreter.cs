     * INERNAL API
     *
     * From an external viewpoint, the GraphInterpreter takes an assembly of graph processing stages encoded as a
     * [[GraphInterpreter#GraphAssembly]] object and provides facilities to execute and interact with this assembly.
     * The lifecylce of the Interpreter is roughly the following:
     *  - Boundary logics are attached via [[attachDownstreamBoundary()]] and [[attachUpstreamBoundary()]]
     *  - [[init()]] is called
     *  - [[execute()]] is called whenever there is need for execution, providing an upper limit on the processed events
     *  - [[finish()]] is called before the interpreter is disposed, preferably after [[isCompleted]] returned true, although
     *    in abort cases this is not strictly necessary
     *
     * The [[execute()]] method of the interpreter accepts an upper bound on the events it will process. After this limit
     * is reached or there are no more pending events to be processed, the call returns. It is possible to inspect
     * if there are unprocessed events left via the [[isSuspended]] method. [[isCompleted]] returns true once all stages
     * reported completion inside the interpreter.
     *
     * The internal architecture of the interpreter is based on the usage of arrays and optimized for reducing allocations
     * on the hot paths.
     *
     * One of the basic abstractions inside the interpreter is the notion of *connection*. In the abstract sense a
     * connection represents an output-input port pair (an analogue for a connected RS Publisher-Subscriber pair),
     * while in the practical sense a connection is a number which represents slots in certain arrays.
     * In particular
     *  - portStates contains a bitfield that tracks the states of the ports (output-input) corresponding to this
     *    connection. This bitfield is used to decode the event that is in-flight.
     *  - connectionSlots is a mapping from a connection id to a potential element or exception that accompanies the
     *    event encoded in the portStates bitfield
     *  - inHandlers is a mapping from a connection id to the [[InHandler]] instance that handles the events corresponding
     *    to the input port of the connection
     *  - outHandlers is a mapping from a connection id to the [[OutHandler]] instance that handles the events corresponding
     *    to the output port of the connection
     *
     * On top of these lookup tables there is an eventQueue, represented as a circular buffer of integers. The integers
     * it contains represents connections that have pending events to be processed. The pending event itself is encoded
     * in the portStates bitfield. This implies that there can be only one event in flight for a given connection, which
     * is true in almost all cases, except a complete-after-push or fail-after-push.
     *
     * The layout of the portStates bitfield is the following:
     *
     *             |- state machn.-| Only one bit is hot among these bits
     *  64  32  16 | 8   4   2   1 |
     * +---+---+---|---+---+---+---|
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  From the following flags only one is active in any given time. These bits encode
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  state machine states, and they are "moved" around using XOR masks to keep other bits
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  intact.
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
     *   |   |   |   |   |   |   +- InReady:  The input port is ready to be pulled
     *   |   |   |   |   |   +----- Pulling:  A pull is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
     *   |   |   |   |   +--------- Pushing:  A push is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
     *   |   |   |   +------------- OutReady: The output port is ready to be pushed
     *   |   |   |
     *   |   |   +----------------- InClosed:  The input port is closed and will not receive any events.
     *   |   |                                 A push might be still in flight which will be then processed first.
     *   |   +--------------------- OutClosed: The output port is closed and will not receive any events.
     *   +------------------------- InFailed:  Always set in conjunction with InClosed. Indicates that the close event
     *                                         is a failure
     *
     * Sending an event is usually the following sequence:
     *  - An action is requested by a stage logic (push, pull, complete, etc.)
     *  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned from a ready state to a pending event
     *  - the id of the affected connection is enqueued
     *
     * Receiving an event is usually the following sequence:
     *  - id of connection to be processed is dequeued
     *  - the type of the event is determined from the bits set on portStates
     *  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned to a ready state
     *  - using the inHandlers/outHandlers table the corresponding callback is called on the stage logic.
     *
     * Because of the FIFO construction of the queue the interpreter is fair, i.e. a pending event is always executed
     * after a bounded number of other events. This property, together with suspendability means that even infinite cycles can
     * be modeled, or even dissolved (if preempted and a "stealing" external event is injected; for example the non-cycle
     * edge of a balance is pulled, dissolving the original cycle).
